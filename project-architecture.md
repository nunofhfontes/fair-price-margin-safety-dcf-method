Explanation of the structure:

-> src/: This is the main source directory that contains our application code.

    - controllers/: Contains the controller logic responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses.

    - services/: Contains business logic that interacts with our models and performs data manipulation.

    - models/: Represents our application's data structures and database schema.

    - routes/: Defines the API routes and maps them to the appropriate controllers.

    - middlewares/: Holds custom middleware functions that can be used globally or on specific routes.

    - utils/: Contains utility functions or helper modules that can be reused throughout the application.

    - app.js: The entry point of our application where you set up the Express app, middleware, routes, etc.

-> tests/: This directory contains our test files. You can organize tests based on the modules they are testing.

-> config/: Houses configuration files for different aspects of our application.

    - database.js: Configuration for connecting to the database.

    - appConfig.js: Application-wide configuration settings.

-> package.json: our project's package file that lists dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

-> README.md: A documentation file that explains how to set up and run our project.

-> frontend1/: This is directory for a frontend webapp. In this particular case, it's the financial-analysis frontend

    - src:/: This is the main source directory that contains our webapplication code

With this structure, we can achieve separation of concerns, modularization, and easy testing. This is just one of many possible project structures, and we might want to adjust it based on our project's specific needs and preferences. As our project grows, we should consider tools like a dependency injection container, logging, and more advanced architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, microservices) if they become necessary.
